					<description><![CDATA[Hey,
I&#039;m a fellow SP blogging course graduate (my blog is https://codetheweb.blog/ ) and couldn&#039;t agree more!
Especially the bit about learning, that is something that I didn&#039;t really think about when I started, but by teaching what I know to other people I have been able to fill gaps in my knowledge and the small details of languages.

Anyway, I&#039;ve been going for a few months now and I got kind of annoyed, because there&#039;s not really a centralized place for us tech bloggers to talk, share ideas, organize guest-posts or give feedback to each other.

So, a few days back I created a Slack room for us to all hang out and give advice etc.

So far there are 13 of us and we want to make it a fun, active and vibrant community so it would be really cool if you joined and came and hung out with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really good to see you&#039;re getting along with your blogging. I like how you&#039;re focusing on learning and logging discoveries in public through your blog.

I also loved the assignment of coming up with 50 blogpost ideas. It was slow at first, but then things just started to click.

Best of luck to you with your blogventures!]]></description>
