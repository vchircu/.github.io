					<description><![CDATA[Hey,
I&#039;m a fellow SP blogging course graduate (my blog is https://codetheweb.blog/ ) and couldn&#039;t agree more!
Especially the bit about learning, that is something that I didn&#039;t really think about when I started, but by teaching what I know to other people I have been able to fill gaps in my knowledge and the small details of languages.

Anyway, I&#039;ve been going for a few months now and I got kind of annoyed, because there&#039;s not really a centralized place for us tech bloggers to talk, share ideas, organize guest-posts or give feedback to each other.

So, a few days back I created a Slack room for us to all hang out and give advice etc.
https://programmingbloggers.herokuapp.com/

So far there are 13 of us and we want to make it a fun, active and vibrant community so it would be really cool if you joined and came and hung out with us!]]></description>

Yes. As the name says, these metrics are good for getting an overview of a code base. On my current project, we have multiple repositories, so I use them to have an overview over how big they are and also how do they compare with one another.]]></description>

Thanks for your reply :) Have you actually applied the metrics to your work?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post - I&#039;m currently researching this exact topic myself. Out of interest, are you using the same thresholds for C# as those described in the book for Java?

Your CQLinq approach looks like much less work than mine - I augmented the VS metrics report using Mono.Cecil]]></description>

Thanks for sharing the link! Really interesting to see how you approached analyzing a code base of that scale. I&#039;ve just finished reading the Software (r)Evolution article series and they are a great addition to the book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the review - interesting to get your perspective on the book. The analyses have evolved since I wrote the book. I do have more examples on how the techniques help improve large codebases. For example this case study on Analyzing Patterns in the Evolution of Linux: http://www.empear.com/blog/software-revolution-part4/]]></description>
